# Introduction to Analysis of Stock Market Index Returns using Normal and Student T Distributions and A Study on Arthritis Treatment

In this repository, you'll find the in-depth analysis of two distinct studies:

## Analysis of Stock Market Index Returns

An examination of the log returns for a stock market index over 1859 consecutive trading days. The log returns are modeled as realisations of independent and identically distributed random variables under two different assumptions: Normal and Student T distributions. Parameters are estimated using the method of moments and the fitting quality is evaluated using data visualisation (Histogram and Quantile-Quantile plot). This repository also presents the calculation of the value at risk and the probability of a significant daily index drop using the preferred (Student T) model.

## Arthritis Treatment Study

A review of a study assessing the effectiveness of two arthritis treatments in adults. The study includes patients from Devon, UK, who were referred for arthritis treatment. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group and an intervention group. The analysis provides point estimates and confidence intervals for the effectiveness of each treatment based on the change in the degree of joint flexion before and after a three-week treatment period.

Both analyses are performed using R, and the code used for the analysis is also available in this repository. These case studies showcase the application of statistical methods in finance and health science scenarios.

This assignment was done as coursework for my University, University Of Exeter Bsc Mathematics, for the module MTH1004: Probability, Statistics and Data. I was awarded a grade of 84/100.
